https://github.com/DyDaDo13/game_of_life/assets/139651579/efcc24a0-68ea-4adc-80fe-50c344e9d4eb

the concept is to draw dots and press space to watch them move

the rules are simple

if the dot actual as left than 2 or more than 3 neighbors the dot die

if the empty spot as exactly 3 neighbors a new dot born

when installed type 'Make'

press 'r' ro reset the map
press 'space' to move to the next generation
hold 'space' to move faster
