The representation of the "GAME OF LIFE"

the concept is to draw dots and press space to watch them move

the rules are simple

if the dot actual as left than 2 or more than 3 neighbors the dot die

if the empty spot as exactly 3 neighbors a new dot born

press 'r' ro reset the map
press 'space' to move to the next generation
hold 'space' to move faster (little bit glitchy with the window on mine pc)
