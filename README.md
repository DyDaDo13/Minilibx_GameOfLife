The representation of the "GAME OF LIFE"

the concept is to draw dots and press space to watch them move

the rules are simple

if the dot actual as left than 2 or more than 3 neighbors the dot die

if the empty spot as exactly 3 neighbors a new dot born

when installed type 'Make'


press 'r' ro reset the map

press 'space' to move to the next generation

hold 'space' to move faster


to change the rules press '3', '4', '5', '6' or type "./Gameoflife 'rule number'"
